Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

See the from* functions below for more\n * convenient ways of constructing Longs.\n *\n * The internal representation of a Long is the two given signed, 32-bit values.\n * We use 32-bit pieces because these are the size of integers on which\n * Javascript performs bit-operations.  For operations like addition and\n * multiplication, we split each number into 16-bit pieces, which can easily be\n * multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow\n * or change in sign.\n *\n * In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the\n * positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.\n * Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE\n * (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as\n * a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this\n * case would often result in infinite recursion.\n *\n * @class\n * @param {number} low  the low (signed) 32 bits of the Long.\n * @param {number} high the high (signed) 32 bits of

For operations like addition and\n * multiplication, we split each number into 16-bit pieces, which can easily be\n * multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow\n * or change in sign.\n *\n * In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the\n * positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.\n * Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE\n * (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as\n * a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).

We can even return completely new customized objects:\n *\n *     if (!schema.options.toObject) schema.options.toObject = {};\n *     schema.options.toObject.transform = function (doc, ret, options) {\n *       return { movie: ret.name }\n *     }\n *\n *     // without the transformation in the schema\n *     doc.toObject(); // { _id: 'anId', name: 'Wreck-it Ralph' }\n *\n *     // with the transformation\n *     doc.toObject(); // { movie: 'Wreck-it Ralph' }\n *\n * _Note: if a transform function returns `undefined`, the return value will be ignored._\n *\n * Transformations may also be applied inline, overridding any transform set in the options:\n *\n *     function xform (doc, ret, options) {\n *       return { inline: ret.name, custom: true }\n *     }\n *\n *     // pass the transform as an inline option\n *     doc.toObject({ transform: xform }); // { inline: 'Wreck-it Ralph', custom: true }\n *\n * _Note: if you call `toObject` and pass any options, the transform declared in your schema options will __not__ be applied. To force its application pass `transform: true`_\n *\n *     if (!schema.options.toObject) schema.options.toObject = {};\n *     schema.options.toObject.hide = '_id';\n *     schema.options.toObject.transform = function (doc, ret, options) {\n *       if (options.hide) {\n *         options.hide.split(' ').forEach(function (prop) {\n *           delete ret[prop];\n *         });\n *       }\n *       return ret;\n *     }\n *\n *     var doc = new Doc({ _id: 'anId', secret: 47, name: 'Wreck-it Ralph' });\n *     doc.toObject();                                        // { secret: 47, name: 'Wreck-it Ralph' }\n *     doc.toObject({ hide: 'secret _id' });                  // { _id: 'anId', secret: 47, name: 'Wreck-it Ralph' }\n *     doc.toObject({ hide: 'secret _id', transform: true }); // { name: 'Wreck-it Ralph' }\n *\n * Transforms are applied _only to the document and are not applied to sub-documents_.\n *\n * Transforms, like all of these options, are also available for `toJSON`.\n *\n * See [schema options](/docs/guide.html#toObject) for some more details.\n *\n * _During save, no custom options are applied to the document before being sent to the database._\n *\n * @param {Object} [options]\n * @return {Object} js object\n * @see mongodb.Binary http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/api-bson-generated/binary.html\n * @api public\n */\n\nDocument.prototype.toObject = function(options) {\n  return this.$toObject(options);\n};\n\n/*!\n * Minimizes an object, removing undefined values and empty objects\n *\n * @param {Object} object to minimize\n * @return {Object}\n */\n\nfunction minimize(obj) {\n  var keys = Object.keys(obj),\n      i = keys.length,\n      hasKeys,\n      key,\n      val;\n\n  while (i--) {\n    key = keys[i];\n    val = obj[key];\n\n    if (utils.isObject(val)) {\n      obj[key] = minimize(val);\n    }\n\n    if (undefined === obj[key]) {\n      delete obj[key];\n      continue;\n    }\n\n    hasKeys = true;\n  }\n\n  return hasKeys\n      ? obj\n      : undefined;\n}\n\n/*!\n * Applies virtuals properties to `json`.\n *\n * @param {Document} self\n * @param {Object} json\n * @param {String} type either `virtuals` or `paths`\n * @return {Object} `json`\n */\n\nfunction applyGetters(self, json, type, options) {\n  var schema = self.schema,\n      paths = Object.keys(schema[type]),\n      i = paths.length,\n      path;\n\n  while (i--) {\n    path = paths[i];\n\n    var parts = path.split('.'),\n        plen = parts.length,\n        last = plen - 1,\n        branch = json,\n        part;\n\n    for (var ii = 0; ii < plen; ++ii) {\n      part = parts[ii];\n      if (ii === last) {\n        branch[part] = clone(self.get(path), options);\n      } else {\n        branch = branch[part] || (branch[part] = {});\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return json;\n}\n\n/**\n * The return value of this method is used in calls to JSON.stringify(doc).\n *\n * This method accepts the same options as [Document#toObject](#document_Document-toObject).

Returning `false` means validation failed.\n *\n * The error message argument is optional. If not passed, the [default generic error message template](#error_messages_MongooseError-messages) will be used.\n *\n * ####Examples:\n *\n *     // make sure every value is equal to \"something\"\n *     function validator (val) {\n *       return val == 'something';\n *     }\n *     new Schema({ name: { type: String, validate: validator }});\n *\n *     // with a custom error message\n *\n *     var custom = [validator, 'Uh oh, {PATH} does not equal \"something\".']\n *     new Schema({ name: { type: String, validate: custom }});\n *\n *     // adding many validators at a time\n *\n *     var many = [\n *         { validator: validator, msg: 'uh oh' }\n *       , { validator: anotherValidator, msg: 'failed' }\n *     ]\n *     new Schema({ name: { type: String, validate: many }});\n *\n *     // or utilizing SchemaType methods directly:\n *\n *     var schema = new Schema({ name: 'string' });\n *     schema.path('name').validate(validator, 'validation of `{PATH}` failed with value `{VALUE}`');\n *\n * ####Error message templates:\n *\n * From the examples above, you may have noticed that error messages support basic templating. There are a few other template keywords besides `{PATH}` and `{VALUE}` too. To find out more, details are available [here](#error_messages_MongooseError.messages)\n *\n * ####Asynchronous validation:\n *\n * Passing a validator function that receives two arguments tells mongoose that the validator is an asynchronous validator. The first argument passed to the validator function is the value being validated. The second argument is a callback function that must called when you finish validating the value and passed either `true` or `false` to communicate either success or failure respectively.\n *\n *     schema.path('name').validate(function (value, respond) {\n *       doStuff(value, function () {\n *         ...\n *         respond(false); // validation failed\n *       })\n *     }, '{PATH} failed validation.');\n *\n *     // or with dynamic message\n *\n *     schema.path('name').validate(function (value, respond) {\n *       doStuff(value, function () {\n *         ...\n *         respond(false, 'this message gets to the validation error');\n *       });\n *     }, 'this message does not matter');\n *\n * You might use asynchronous validators to retreive other documents from the database to validate against or to meet other I/O bound validation needs.\n *\n * Validation occurs `pre('save')` or whenever you manually execute [document#validate](#document_Document-validate).\n *\n * If validation fails during `pre('save')` and no callback was passed to receive the error, an `error` event will be emitted on your Models associated db [connection](#connection_Connection), passing the validation error object along.\n *\n *     var conn = mongoose.createConnection(..);\n *     conn.on('error', handleError);\n *\n *     var Product = conn.model('Product', yourSchema);\n *     var dvd = new Product(..);\n *     dvd.save(); // emits error on the `conn` above\n *\n * If you desire handling these errors at the Model level, attach an `error` listener to your Model and the event will instead be emitted there.\n *\n *     // registering an error listener on the Model lets us handle errors more locally\n *     Product.on('error', handleError);\n *\n * @param {RegExp|Function|Object} obj validator\n * @param {String} [errorMsg] optional error message\n * @param {String} [type] optional validator type\n * @return {SchemaType} this\n * @api public\n */\n\nSchemaType.prototype.validate = function(obj, message, type) {\n  if (typeof obj === 'function' || obj && utils.getFunctionName(obj.constructor) === 'RegExp') {\n    var properties;\n    if (message instanceof Object && !type) {\n      properties = utils.clone(message);\n      if (!properties.message) {\n        properties.message = properties.msg;\n      }\n      properties.validator = obj;\n      properties.type = properties.type || 'user defined';\n    } else {\n      if (!message) {\n        message = MongooseError.messages.general.default;\n      }\n      if (!type) {\n        type = 'user defined';\n      }\n      properties = {message: message, type: type, validator: obj};\n    }\n    this.validators.push(properties);\n    return this;\n  }\n\n  var i,\n      length,\n      arg;\n\n  for (i = 0, length = arguments.length; i < length; i++) {\n    arg = arguments[i];\n    if (!(arg && utils.getFunctionName(arg.constructor) === 'Object')) {\n      var msg = 'Invalid validator.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Then the code starts with all zero bits\n   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards\n   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the\n   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes\n   are incremented backwards.\n\n   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in\n   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.

See the comments in inftrees.h\n   for more information.\n\n   sym increments through all symbols, and the loop terminates when\n   all codes of length max, i.e. all codes, have been processed.  This\n   routine permits incomplete codes, so another loop after this one fills\n   in the rest of the decoding tables with invalid code markers.\n   */\n\n  /* set up for code type */\n  // poor man optimization - use if-else instead of switch,\n  // to avoid deopts in old v8\n  if (type === CODES) {\n    base = extra = work;    /* dummy value--not used */\n    end = 19;\n\n  } else if (type === LENS) {\n    base = lbase;\n    base_index -= 257;\n    extra = lext;\n    extra_index -= 257;\n    end = 256;\n\n  } else {                    /* DISTS */\n    base = dbase;\n    extra = dext;\n    end = -1;\n  }\n\n  /* initialize opts for loop */\n  huff = 0;                   /* starting code */\n  sym = 0;                    /* starting code symbol */\n  len = min;                  /* starting code length */\n  next = table_index;              /* current table to fill in */\n  curr = root;                /* current table index bits */\n  drop = 0;                   /* current bits to drop from code for index */\n  low = -1;                   /* trigger new sub-table when len > root */\n  used = 1 << root;          /* use root table entries */\n  mask = used - 1;            /* mask for comparing low */\n\n  /* check available table space */\n  if ((type === LENS && used > ENOUGH_LENS) ||\n    (type === DISTS && used > ENOUGH_DISTS)) {\n    return 1;\n  }\n\n  var i = 0;\n  /* process all codes and make table entries */\n  for (;;) {\n    i++;\n    /* create table entry */\n    here_bits = len - drop;\n    if (work[sym] < end) {\n      here_op = 0;\n      here_val = work[sym];\n    }\n    else if (work[sym] > end) {\n      here_op = extra[extra_index + work[sym]];\n      here_val = base[base_index + work[sym]];\n    }\n    else {\n      here_op = 32 + 64;         /* end of block */\n      here_val = 0;\n    }\n\n    /* replicate for those indices with low len bits equal to huff */\n    incr = 1 << (len - drop);\n    fill = 1 << curr;\n    min = fill;                 /* save offset to next table */\n    do {\n      fill -= incr;\n      table[next + (huff >> drop) + fill] = (here_bits << 24) | (here_op << 16) | here_val |0;\n    } while (fill !== 0);\n\n    /* backwards increment the len-bit code huff */\n    incr = 1 << (len - 1);\n    while (huff & incr) {\n      incr >>= 1;\n    }\n    if (incr !== 0) {\n      huff &= incr - 1;\n      huff += incr;\n    } else {\n      huff = 0;\n    }\n\n    /* go to next symbol, update count, len */\n    sym++;\n    if (--count[len] === 0) {\n      if (len === max) { break; }\n      len = lens[lens_index + work[sym]];\n    }\n\n    /* create new sub-table if needed */\n    if (len > root && (huff & mask) !== low) {\n      /* if first time, transition to sub-tables */\n      if (drop === 0) {\n        drop = root;\n      }\n\n      /* increment past last table */\n      next += min;            /* here min is 1 << curr */\n\n      /* determine length of next table */\n      curr = len - drop;\n      left = 1 << curr;\n      while (curr + drop < max) {\n        left -= count[curr + drop];\n        if (left <= 0) { break; }\n        curr++;\n        left <<= 1;\n      }\n\n      /* check for enough space */\n      used += 1 << curr;\n      if ((type === LENS && used > ENOUGH_LENS) ||\n        (type === DISTS && used > ENOUGH_DISTS)) {\n        return 1;\n      }\n\n      /* point entry in root table to sub-table */\n      low = huff & mask;\n      /*table.op[low] = curr;\n      table.bits[low] = root;\n      table.val[low] = next - opts.table_index;*/\n      table[low] = (root << 24) | (curr << 16) | (next - table_index) |0;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /* fill in remaining table entry if code is incomplete (guaranteed to have\n   at most one remaining entry, since if the code is incomplete, the\n   maximum code length that was allowed to get this far is one bit) */\n  if (huff !== 0) {\n    //table.op[next + huff] = 64;            /* invalid code marker */\n    //table.bits[next + huff] = len - drop;\n    //table.val[next + huff] = 0;\n    table[next + huff] = ((len - drop) << 24) | (64 << 16) |0;\n  }\n\n  /* set return parameters */\n  //opts.table_index += used;\n  opts.bits = root;\n  return 0;\n};\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/pako/lib/zlib/inftrees.js\n ** module id = 330\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  /* Allowed flush values; see deflate() and inflate() below for details */\n  Z_NO_FLUSH:         0,\n  Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH:    1,\n  Z_SYNC_FLUSH:       2,\n  Z_FULL_FLUSH:       3,\n  Z_FINISH:           4,\n  Z_BLOCK:            5,\n  Z_TREES:            6,\n\n  /* Return codes for the compression/decompression functions.

If an exception occured, `err`\n * should be set.\n *\n * Options:\n *\n *   - `requestTokenURL`       URL used to obtain an unauthorized request token\n *   - `accessTokenURL`        URL used to exchange a user-authorized request token for an access token\n *   - `userAuthorizationURL`  URL used to obtain user authorization\n *   - `consumerKey`           identifies client to service provider\n *   - `consumerSecret`        secret used to establish ownership of the consumer key\n *   - 'signatureMethod'       signature method used to sign the request (default: 'HMAC-SHA1')\n *   - `callbackURL`           URL to which the service provider will redirect the user after obtaining authorization\n *   - `passReqToCallback`     when `true`, `req` is the first argument to the verify callback (default: `false`)\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n *     passport.use(new OAuthStrategy({\n *         requestTokenURL: 'https://www.example.com/oauth/request_token',\n *         accessTokenURL: 'https://www.example.com/oauth/access_token',\n *         userAuthorizationURL: 'https://www.example.com/oauth/authorize',\n *         consumerKey: '123-456-789',\n *         consumerSecret: 'shhh-its-a-secret'\n *         callbackURL: 'https://www.example.net/auth/example/callback'\n *       },\n *       function(token, tokenSecret, profile, cb) {\n *         User.findOrCreate(..., function (err, user) {\n *           cb(err, user);\n *         });\n *       }\n *     ));\n *\n * @constructor\n * @param {Object} options\n * @param {Function} verify\n * @api public\n */\nfunction OAuthStrategy(options, verify) {\n  if (typeof options == 'function') {\n    verify = options;\n    options = undefined;\n  }\n  options = options || {};\n  \n  if (!verify) { throw new TypeError('OAuthStrategy requires a verify callback'); }\n  if (!options.requestTokenURL) { throw new TypeError('OAuthStrategy requires a requestTokenURL option'); }\n  if (!options.accessTokenURL) { throw new TypeError('OAuthStrategy requires a accessTokenURL option'); }\n  if (!options.userAuthorizationURL) { throw new TypeError('OAuthStrategy requires a userAuthorizationURL option'); }\n  if (!options.consumerKey) { throw new TypeError('OAuthStrategy requires a consumerKey option'); }\n  if (options.consumerSecret === undefined) { throw new TypeError('OAuthStrategy requires a consumerSecret option'); }\n  \n  passport.Strategy.call(this);\n  this.name = 'oauth';\n  this._verify = verify;\n  \n  // NOTE: The _oauth property is considered \"protected\".
